# Where am I?

_Probably not where you want to be_

You're in a room. It's dark. Silent. As your eyes become accustomed to the gloom you
notice something on the wall opposite. Squinting, you read:

**404 Page Not Found**

It might be written in blood or something. I don't know. This story's gone on too long
already.

What I'm trying to say is the page you're looking for can't be found. Sorry.
